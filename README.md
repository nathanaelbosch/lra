# Low Rank Approximation - Final Project

Goal is to implement the higher order SVD, as well as some other things. Matricisations and m-mode matrix multiplications have been implemented from scratch using [numpy](https://numpy.org).

## Setup
Install the necessary packages, preferrably in a virtual environment:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Usage
Exercise 1:
```python -m lra.ex1```
Exercise 4:
```python -m lra.ex4```

## Testing
I implemented simple tests with [pytest](https://pytest.org) to check the validity of the code, mostly the basics in `lra/tools`. Testing can be done with
```pytest```
