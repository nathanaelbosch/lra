# Low Rank Approximation - Final Project

Goal is to implement the higher order SVD, as well as some other things. Matricisations and m-mode matrix multiplications have been implemented from scratch using [numpy](https://numpy.org).

## Usage
So far the code can be run with 
```python -m lra.ex1```
but it might be more convenient to look through the code and play around with it in a console. Future work might include a structured presentation of my work in a jupyter notebook.

## Testing
I implemented simple tests with [pytest](https://pytest.org) to check the validity of the code, mostly the basics in `lra/tools`. Testing can be done with
```pytest```
